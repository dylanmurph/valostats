## Database & Relationships

This project uses 5 main tables:
- `players`
- `agents`
- `valorant_maps`
- `player_agent_stats`
- `player_map_stats`

### Relationships
- `players` <-> `player_agent_stats`
- `players` <-> `player_map_stats`
- `agents` <->  `player_agent_stats`
- `valorant_maps` <-> `player_map_stats`
- `player_agent_stats` and `player_map_stats`  belong to `player` and `agent/map`

### Seeding
The database is seeded with true map/agent data from Valorant.

The seeder FullStatSeeder generates realistic randomised mock data of players with their map/agent statistics
